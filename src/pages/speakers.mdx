<Speaker name="Asia Rawls" Image={asiaImage} talk={{ title: "Driving User Enthusiasm with Gamification", 
description: "This talk focuses on meeting business objectives through software development, driven by gamification. Typically, the UX aims to understand the individual’s experience using a product or service. However, it’s time to expound upon this idea and drive the user’s interest through drive and impulse. Is the user motivated or excited through the software application? Do they feel challenged? Are they notified about milestones achieved? Are they compelled and recognized? Does your application only care about when things are going wrong? This talk will focus on different ways to stimulate performance and put users in the zone. There are so many software applications unused because they fail to impact the user emotionally and psychologically."}}

description: "When it comes to sextech, people often let their imaginations get in the way of the facts. One common reason is that the media likes to focus primarily on VR porn and bang-able robots. In reality these subjects are just a small uncommon sliver on the sextech spectrum. Sextech spans everything from menopause technology and sex ed apps for teens to teledildonics and erotica audiobooks.\r\n\r\nYou encounter it when you use an app to track your menstrual cycle, talk to an A.I. OBGYN chatbot, or simply viewing adult content.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I\'ll describe:\r\n\u2022 briefly what sextech is and is not\r\n\r\n\u2022 the current biases sextech faces and how it detrimentally impacts marginalized groups, leads to sexual abuse and stifles innovation within the industry \r\n\r\n\u2022 why sextech is the most lucrative sector of technology based on growth statistics, use-cases and the human experience.\r\n\r\n\u2022 why adding \u201Ctech\" to the end of \u201Csex\u201D gives us \u201Cpermission\u201D to start dialogue on a taboo topic. The tech sector is uniquely positioned to remove the stigma surrounding one of the most common human experiences, and this is important for eliminating the professional risk associated with working in sextech. Technology enables bright minds to come forward and provide real world solutions to things like human trafficking, STIs, sexual assault, sex-ed, and more.\r\n\r\n\u2022 why being informed on the subject will make you a more well-rounded inclusive technologist and advocate for a more diverse and progressive tech industry"}}

Yet, as we explore this workflow, we start uncovering the efficiencies that we gain, and things become fascinating.As a result, we will show what it feels like to write software that responds to change, as a true sensation of agility emerges, driven not by Scrum, but instead, driven by better code." }}

description: "Want to write a web application? Better get familiar with JavaScript.JavaScript has long been the king of front-end. While there have been various attempts to dethrone it, they have typically involved treating JavaScript as an assembly-language analog that you transpile your code to. This has lead to complex build pipelines that result in JavaScript which the browser has to parse and *you* still have to debug. But what if there were an actual byte-code language you could compile your non-JavaScript code to instead? That is what WebAssembly is. I am going to explain how WebAssembly works and how to use it in this talk. I will cover what it is, how it fits into your application, and how to build and use your own WebAssembly modules. And, I will demo how to build and use those modules with both Rust and the WebAssembly Text Format. That is right, I will be live coding in an assembly language. I will also go over some online resources for other languages and tools that make use of WebAssembly. When we are done, you will have the footing you need to start building applications featuring WebAssembly. So grab a non-JavaScript language, a modern browser, and let us get started!" }}

To create components often we turn to frameworks such as Angular, React, and Vue but we don\'t need to. Using nothing more than HTML and Javascript that is readily available to us in all modern browsers we can create components that work without being tied to any one front-end framework.

<Speaker name="Milu Franz" Image={milufranzImage} talk={{ title: "Pros and Cons of Using VueJS vs ReactJS", 
description: "Vue has recently gained significant attention and many developers proficient in React JS are contemplating learning Vue JS as a new skillset. Being so similar in scope, the speakers goal is to provide the audience with enough information about both front-end JavaScript frameworks to facilitate the decision of learning and using either of them in future development projects. In order to achieve this, this presentation will provide a code side-by-side comparison of a simple sign in one-page app created using both VueJS and ReactJS. This comparison will ensure technical accuracy and highlight where one framework outshines the other. Furthermore, this presentation will discuss the similarities and differences of both frameworks in regards to installation, runtime performance, HTML & CSS, scalability, data manipulation, props (passed from parent-to-child and child-to-parent components), event listeners, and available libraries." }}
