description: "When it comes to sextech, people often let their imaginations get in the way of the facts. One common reason is that the media likes to focus primarily on VR porn and bang-able robots. In reality these subjects are just a small uncommon sliver on the sextech spectrum. Sextech spans everything from menopause technology and sex ed apps for teens to teledildonics and erotica audiobooks.\r\n\r\nYou encounter it when you use an app to track your menstrual cycle, talk to an A.I. OBGYN chatbot, or simply viewing adult content.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I\'ll describe:\r\n\u2022 briefly what sextech is and is not\r\n\r\n\u2022 the current biases sextech faces and how it detrimentally impacts marginalized groups, leads to sexual abuse and stifles innovation within the industry \r\n\r\n\u2022 why sextech is the most lucrative sector of technology based on growth statistics, use-cases and the human experience.\r\n\r\n\u2022 why adding \u201Ctech\" to the end of \u201Csex\u201D gives us \u201Cpermission\u201D to start dialogue on a taboo topic. The tech sector is uniquely positioned to remove the stigma surrounding one of the most common human experiences, and this is important for eliminating the professional risk associated with working in sextech. Technology enables bright minds to come forward and provide real world solutions to things like human trafficking, STIs, sexual assault, sex-ed, and more.\r\n\r\n\u2022 why being informed on the subject will make you a more well-rounded inclusive technologist and advocate for a more diverse and progressive tech industry"}}

Yet, as we explore this workflow, we start uncovering the efficiencies that we gain, and things become fascinating.As a result, we will show what it feels like to write software that responds to change, as a true sensation of agility emerges, driven not by Scrum, but instead, driven by better code." }}

description: "More often than not developers fall into the trap of wanting to use some shinny trend heard in the IT world and that is no different with web components. Do you really understand the design decisions behind the concept of web components? In this talk we will take a deep dive into what it is all about.In the last few years the term web components have become a main stay in frontend development and web development at large. This popularity as usual tends to come with a huge adoption in the industry albeit without people actually understanding the core concepts behind this new frenzy they have encountered. This is not limited to juniors alone. The goal of this talk is to give a deep dive into the background behind components, where it came from, how it has evolved and possibly what we might see in the future." }}
